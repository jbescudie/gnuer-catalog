"""here we centralize the schema describing our experiments.

first we define everything considered a hyperparmeters.
then we define the data model for logging results.


# the term HPARAMS here is confusing
#          e.g. using RESULTS would be easier to read here
#          but actually TYPE would have been more generic from the beginning
